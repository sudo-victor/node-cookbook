# Handling Standard I/O

STDIN (standard in) -> Is a stream used to read a input from a command shell or terminal

STDOUT (standard out) -> Is stream used to write a something in the terminal, output

STDERR (standard error) -> Similar of stdout but is stream used only for write errors and diagnostic data


Each I/O act, emit data events chunk of data received. We can use the event called "data" to get a Buffer object when the client press Enter.
